# CNT4007-Project

## Project Group 34
Team Members: Kevin Zhang, John Midel Miclat, Justus Geslani

Our team has worked relentlessly on the project. I believe that our TCP connections and peer-to-peer connections work correctly, with appropriate bitfieldds. The handshaking protocols should be implemented correctly as well. We have the skeletons for the message sending protocols, the choking, and optimistic unchoking protocols, but unfortunately we encountered significant bugs that we were unable to tackle. However, we want it to be known that significant effort was dedicated to the creation and design of such protocols. 

- Kevin, John, Justus

- As for member contributions, Justus worked on the logging functionality and the initial peer config files, as well as some of the peer manager cases. John worked with the actual message and handshake message classes, updated the config files, as well as contributions to the various handlers utilized for our code. Kevin created much of the functionality for the peer manager cases, as well as tying together much of the handlers with the actual implementation of the protocols.

- Thank you for checking out our project repository!
